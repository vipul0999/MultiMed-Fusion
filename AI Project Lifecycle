# 1. Business Understanding
Doctors spend a lot of time going through lab results, medical scans, and notes separately, which slows down decision-making. Patients are also concerned about the safety of their personal health information.
Goal: Build a tool that combines these medical files and produces short, secure summaries to save time and protect privacy.

# 2. Data Understanding
- Determine the types of input data required (reports, images, audio).
- Look for publicly accessible or testable datasets.
- Assess data quality, identify potential gaps, and note privacy risks.

# 3. Data Preparation
- Clean text data and remove sensitive identifiers.
- Convert audio notes into text form.
- Standardize images so they are ready for analysis.
- Create a process to anonymize all data before use.

# 4. Model Building
- Train a summarization model for reports and notes.
- Add an image analysis step for interpreting scans.
- Combine the text and image outputs into a quick summary.
- Refine the models step by step until the summaries are accurate and easy to read.

# 5. Evaluation
- Check the AI-generated summaries by comparing them with expert-written ones.
- Measure performance using accuracy, readability, and privacy checks.
- Gather feedback from doctors and medical students.
- Fine-tune models based on evaluation results.

# 6. Model Deployment
- Build a secure web interface where doctors can upload medical files.
- Show summaries together with links to the original documents.
- Make sure the system follows healthcare rules such as HIPAA and GDPR.

# 7. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Keep an eye on performance to spot drops in accuracy.
- Record and fix errors quickly.
- Refresh models with new data or formats when needed.
- Carry out regular checks to confirm privacy and compliance.
