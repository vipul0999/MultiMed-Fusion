# Research Notes – Medical AI Summarizer  
_Date: 2025-09-03_

## 1. Project Brief
A tool that collects medical files such as lab reports, medical images, and audio notes, then uses AI to create easy-to-read summaries for doctors.

### User Stories
- **Doctor:** Wants a single summary from different sources to save time.  
  - *Acceptance:* AI creates a summary with links back to original files.  
- **Patient:** Wants private details removed to keep their data safe.  
  - *Acceptance:* Uploaded files are anonymized before saving.

## 2. Key Research Areas

### a) Clinical & Radiology Summarization
- Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate concise summaries of discharge notes, radiology reports, and clinical conversations.  
- Common datasets: **MIMIC-CXR**, **RadSum23**, **MEDIQA** tasks.  
- Evaluation metrics include **ROUGE**, **BERTScore**, and **clinician factuality review**.  

### b) Privacy & De-identification
- **HIPAA** defines 18 Protected Health Information (PHI) identifiers.  
- De-identification methods: **Safe Harbor** (remove 18 identifiers) and **Expert Determination**.  
- **Text de-ID tools:** i2b2/n2c2 datasets, Microsoft **Presidio**, rule-based + ML NER.  
- **Image de-ID:** DICOM PS3.15 Annex E profiles for removing PHI from headers and burned-in text.  

### c) Traceability & Interoperability
- **FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) provides **DocumentReference** and **Media** resources to keep links back to original files.  
- Ensures transparency and clinical trust in AI-generated summaries.

## 4. Open Questions
- Which summarization model (BioBART, ClinicalBERT, or LLM like GPT-4/MedPaLM) is most suitable for multi-source input?  
- How to reliably evaluate factual correctness of summaries?  
- What toolchain is best for de-identification: purely rule-based vs hybrid ML (e.g., Presidio + NER)?  
- How to design UI so Doctors can trace every summary point back to the original source?

## 5. Next Steps
- Gather more papers on **clinical summarization benchmarks (2023–2025)**.  
- Explore **open-source de-identification pipelines** and test them on sample notes.  
- Review **FHIR DocumentReference examples** for linking originals.  
- Build daily logs to track findings and commit them to GitHub.
