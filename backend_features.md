# Backend Features â€“ MultiMed Fusion

The backend of MultiMed Fusion is responsible for handling data collection, anonymization, AI-driven summarization, and secure storage.  
It is built with **Python (Flask/FastAPI)** and integrates multiple libraries and services to support multimodal healthcare data.

## ðŸ”§ Core Backend Features

### 1. File Upload & Management
- Accepts **PDF reports, DICOM images, and audio notes** through secure upload endpoints.
- Enforces file size limits and validates supported formats.
- Assigns metadata (file type, timestamp, user ID) to each upload.
- Supports **file versioning** to keep historical records for compliance.

### 2. Data Anonymization
- Uses **spaCy + regex** to remove personal identifiers from text reports.
- Leverages **pydicom** to strip metadata from medical images.
- Hashes patient IDs into anonymized tokens for consistent referencing.
- Logs anonymization steps for **traceability and auditing**.

### 3. AI Summarization Pipeline
- Runs uploaded files through preprocessing (OCR for PDFs, transcription for audio).
- Uses **PyTorch/TensorFlow + Hugging Face Transformers** for generating summaries.
- Combines multimodal inputs into a unified summary document.
- Adds **critical findings highlight** (e.g., abnormal lab values flagged in red).

### 4. API Endpoints
- RESTful API with endpoints for:
  - File upload (`/upload`)
  - Generate summary (`/summarize`)
  - Retrieve summaries (`/summaries/{id}`)
  - Anonymization testing (`/anonymize/test`)
- **GraphQL API support** for flexible queries (e.g., fetch summaries by patient, date).
- Returns results in **JSON** for easy integration with frontend or hospital systems.

### 5. Database & Storage
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL** used for storing summaries, metadata, and anonymized references.
- Stores large files (scans, audio) in cloud storage (AWS S3 or equivalent).
- Ensures traceability by linking every summary back to its original file.
- Supports **caching (Redis)** for repeated queries to reduce latency.

### 6. Security & Privacy
- Implements **JWT authentication** for secure API access.
- Encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS, TLS).
- Provides audit logs of file uploads, anonymization, and summary generation.
- **Role-based access control** ensures only authorized users access sensitive data.

### 7. Monitoring & Health Checks
- Provides `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints for system diagnostics.
- Logs backend performance metrics (API latency, request counts).
- Integrated with monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus/Grafana**) for observability.

### 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **PyTest** used for backend unit and integration tests.
- **Postman** collections to validate API endpoints.
- Continuous Integration (CI) via **GitHub Actions** ensures code quality.
- Automated test coverage reports generated with each commit.

### 9. Notifications
- Email and in-app notifications when AI summaries are ready.
- Configurable SMTP settings for hospitals to use their own email servers.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
- Background processing using **Celery + Redis** for heavy AI tasks.
- Integration endpoints for **EHR (Electronic Health Record) systems**.
- Real-time **WebSocket support** for live updates in the dashboard.
- Scalable deployment with **Docker + Kubernetes** for large hospital environments.
