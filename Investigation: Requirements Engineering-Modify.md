**Investigation:** Requirements Engineering

**1\. What is** **requirement engineering?**  
<br/>a. Requirements engineering is a structured process to identify, analyze, and regulate the needs and limitations of a software project. The increasing needs of the industrial market in software development require companies that produce software to provide functions and features for owners, managers, and end-users to benefit from the software built \[1\]. Software development institutions must be able to collect system requirements as a whole to carry out the development objectives \[2\]. The process of collecting requirements for the needs of the system must be carried out by a professional who specializes in in-depth needs analysis in the field of requirements engineering because the critical phase in designing a system is in the software requirements process when the needs are loaded, to ensure that all needs are sufficient and have been met \[3\], \[4\], \[5\].

**2\. In an agile/iterative software development setting, will you undergo this process once or multiple times?**  
<br/>a. In Agile, we don't just gather requirements once and move on. Instead, the process repeats many times because the work is divided into short development cycles called sprints. Each sprint includes collecting requirements, building, testing, and then showing the results to the customer or stakeholder. After feedback, adjustments are made, and the next sprint begins.  
<br/>**3\. What are the different** **requirements engineering activities? Who takes part in those activities?**  
<br/>a. The main activities in requirements engineering include:  
<br/>**Elicitation** - gathering ideas and needs from stakeholders.  
<br/>**Analysis and negotiation** - reviewing those needs, spotting conflicts, and finding trade-offs.  
<br/>**Specification** - writing down the requirements in a structured format.  
<br/>**Validation** - confirming with stakeholders that the requirements make sense.  
<br/>**Management** - tracking updates and changes throughout the project.  
<br/>b. Following parties are involved:

- Stakeholders
- Developers
- Business analysts/requirements engineers
- Project manager
- Testers/QA

<br/>**4\. Define each of the participants in the above activities (example: developer, stakeholder)**

**Stakeholders:** clients, end-users, or managers who explain what they need.  
<br/>**Developers:** the team members who design, code, and build the system.  
<br/>**Business analysts/requirements engineers:** people who connect the technical team with the business side and clarify requirements.  
<br/>**Project manager**: makes sure work is completed on time and within budget.  
<br/>**Testers/QA:** check that the requirements are testable and properly implemented.  

**5\. For each of the roles in the above two questions, identify who fills those roles.**  

• **Developers:** Anil, Charan, Srinivas, Vipul  
<br/>• **Stakeholder:** Prof. Mark Chai  
<br/>• **Business analysts:** Anil, Srinivas  
<br/>• **Testers/QA:** Charan  
<br/>• **Project manager:** Vipul  
<br/>**6\. Define functional requirement.**  
<br/>Functional requirements describe the actual features that should be present in the software. They are the requirements of what the system must do.  
Example: "Users should be able to log in with an email and password, just like we do when accessing Canvas or Gmail."  
<br/>**7\. Define non-functional requirement.**  
<br/>Non-functional requirements describe qualities of the software solution. These explain how the system should perform.  
Example: "The login process should take less than three seconds, so users don't get frustrated, like when a banking app takes too long to load."  
<br/>**8\. What project artifacts (documents, etc) should result from requirements engineering?**  
<br/>Some of the documents and outputs from requirements engineering include:  
<br/>• A requirements specification or backlog.  
<br/>• User stories, use cases, or acceptance criteria.  
<br/>• Diagrams like UML or flowcharts.  
<br/>• A traceability matrix to map requirements to testing and implementation.  
<br/>**9\. Define requirements elicitation.**  
<br/>Requirements elicitation is the process of drawing out requirements from clients and users. Teams usually use interviews, workshops, brainstorming, observation, or surveys to capture this information.  
<br/>**10\. What** **are the sequence of steps one should take during requirements elicitation? Which step is potentially the hardest?**  
<br/>**The sequence of steps during requirements elicitation are:**  
<br/>1\. Identify who the stakeholders are.  
<br/>2\. Choose the right techniques to collect requirements.  
<br/>3\. Conduct meetings or sessions.  
<br/>4\. Document the findings clearly.  
<br/>5\. Validate them with the client.  
<br/>Clarifying and confirming the client's true desires is often the hardest part. Clients may not always explain their needs clearly, may change their minds, or have different priorities. That's why making sure all requirements are accurate and consistent is such a challenge.  
<br/>**11\. What are key things you should try to identify when working with the client? What kinds of questions should you ask?**  
<br/>**Key things to identify include:**  
<br/>• The aims and objectives of the client  
<br/>• Primary users and stakeholders  
<br/>• Functional requirements (features)  
<br/>• Non-functional requirements (performance, usability, etc.)  
<br/>• Restrictions (budget, schedule, and laws)  
<br/>• Priorities (necessary vs. desirable)  
<br/>**Questions to ask the client:**  
<br/>• What issue are you trying to solve?  
<br/>• Who will use the system?  
<br/>• Which features are most important?  
<br/>• What security or performance requirements are expected?  
<br/>• What budget and time limits are we working with?
