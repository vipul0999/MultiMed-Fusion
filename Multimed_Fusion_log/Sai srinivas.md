### **Daily Log: September 15, 2025**

# Use Case: Multi Med Fusion

## 1. Goal
The doctor wants to get a quick, accurate summary of a patient's medical history to save time and review all information from various files.

## 2. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** Doctor  
- **System:** The AI Medical Summary Tool  

## 3. Preconditions
- The doctor has an active account and is logged into the system.  
- The patient's medical files (e.g., lab reports, images, audio notes) are available and accessible to the doctor.  
- The system's AI is operational and ready to process new data.  

## 4. Main Flow
1. The doctor navigates to the patient's record.  
2. The doctor selects the medical files to be processed (e.g., uploads new files or selects existing ones from a list).  
3. The doctor clicks the **"Generate Summary"** button.  
4. The system anonymizes the uploaded files by removing patient-identifying information.  
5. The system sends the anonymized files to the AI for analysis.  
6. The AI processes the files and generates a summary.  
7. The system receives the AI-generated summary.  
8. The system displays the summary to the doctor, including links back to the original source files for verification.  

## 5. Postconditions
- An AI-generated summary is successfully created and stored in the patient's record.  
- The original, uploaded files remain anonymized to ensure patient privacy.  

## 6. Alternative and Exception Flows
- **No Files Selected:** The system displays a message, *"Please select one or more files to generate a summary."* The process ends.  
- **File Format Not Supported:** The system alerts the doctor with an error message, *"Unsupported file type. Please upload a lab report, medical image, or audio note."* The process ends.  
- **AI Processing Error:** If the AI fails to generate a summary, the system displays an error message, *"Unable to generate a summary at this time. Please try again later or contact support."*  
- **AI Generates Vague/Incomplete Summary:** The doctor has the option to flag the summary as incomplete or unhelpful. This feedback is logged for future AI model improvement.

### **Daily Log: September 22 , 2025**
### **Backend Features & Technologies**

The backend is the brain of the application, handling all the logic, data processing, and security.

* **RESTful API:** The core of the backend is a RESTful API built to handle requests from the frontend. This API will manage user authentication, file uploads, AI processing triggers, and data retrieval.
* **Microservices Architecture:** To ensure scalability and maintainability, the backend can be broken down into specialized services:
    * **User Service:** Handles user authentication, profile management, and role-based access control (doctor, admin).
    * **File Upload Service:** Manages secure file uploads, validation, and storage. It will be responsible for sending files to the Anonymization Service.
    * **Anonymization Service:** A dedicated service that uses a library or AI to identify and remove PII from the uploaded medical documents.
    * **AI Processing Service:** Triggers the AI model to analyze the anonymized files and generate a summary. This service can be an isolated environment to handle the computational load.
    * **Data Service:** Manages the database, handling all read and write operations for patient records, summaries, and file metadata.
* **Technology Stack:**
    * **Backend Framework:** Python with **Django** or **Flask** for rapid development and extensive library support.
    * **Database:** **PostgreSQL** is a great choice for its robust support for structured and unstructured data, ensuring data integrity and security.
    * **AI/ML:** **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** can be used to build and deploy the custom AI model for summarization. Pre-trained models like **GPT-3** or similar large language models can be used via their APIs, trained on medical data to improve accuracy.
    * **File Storage:** **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** for secure and scalable storage of encrypted medical files.
    * **Task Queue:** **Celery** with **Redis** to manage background tasks like file anonymization and AI processing, preventing the user interface from freezing during long operations.

---

### **Data Models**

The database schema is the blueprint for how data is stored and organized.

* **`User` Model:**
    * `id` (Primary Key)
    * `username` (string, unique)
    * `password_hash` (string)
    * `email` (string, unique)
    * `is_doctor` (boolean)
    * `created_at` (datetime)
* **`Patient` Model:**
    * `id` (Primary Key)
    * `doctor_id` (Foreign Key to `User`)
    * `anonymized_id` (string, unique, generated by the system)
    * `created_at` (datetime)
* **`File` Model:**
    * `id` (Primary Key)
    * `patient_id` (Foreign Key to `Patient`)
    * `file_name` (string)
    * `file_type` (string, e.g., 'PDF', 'DICOM', 'MP3')
    * `storage_url` (string, a link to the encrypted file in S3)
    * `is_anonymized` (boolean, defaults to False)
    * `upload_date` (datetime)
* **`Summary` Model:**
    * `id` (Primary Key)
    * `patient_id` (Foreign Key to `Patient`)
    * `summary_text` (text)
    * `source_files` (JSON array of `File` IDs)
    * `created_at` (datetime)

---

### **Web Pages**

These are the user-facing parts of the application, designed to be simple and intuitive.

* **1. Login/Authentication Page:**
    * **Purpose:** Allows doctors to securely log in or register.
    * **Inputs:** Username/email and password.
    * **Logic:** Validates credentials against the `User` model. If successful, redirects to the Dashboard.
* **2. Doctor Dashboard Page:**
    * **Purpose:** The main hub for the doctor, providing an an overview of their patients.
    * **Content:** A list of the doctor's patients, with options to add a new patient or view an existing one.
* **3. Patient Profile Page:**
    * **Purpose:** Displays all information and files for a single patient.
    * **Sections:**
        * **Patient Details:** Anonymized patient ID.

---

## **2. ER Diagram Overview**

**Description:**  
The system follows a **relational database model (PostgreSQL / MySQL)**, linking key entities (Users, Patients, Doctors, Files, Summaries, Notifications, Logs) through primary and foreign keys.

**Core Relationships:**
- A **User** can be either a Doctor or a Patient (1–1 relationship).  
- A **Patient** can have multiple **Files** and **Summaries** (1–M).  
- A **Doctor** can create multiple **Summaries** for different Patients (1–M).  
- Each **File** has one **Anonymization record** (1–1).  
- A **User** can receive many **Notifications** (1–M).  
- All user activities are tracked through **Audit Logs**.

---

## **3. Data Security Plan**

# MultiMed Fusion – Comprehensive Data Management Plan

---

### **Daily Log: October 15 , 2025**

## **Objective**
To define a **complete Data Management Plan (DMP)** for the MultiMed Fusion system, outlining how data will be **collected, stored, secured, managed, and mapped** to the system’s functional requirements.  
This ensures that the system is efficient, secure, compliant, and scalable as it handles sensitive multi-modal medical data.

---

## **1. Overview**

**MultiMed Fusion** collects diverse data types such as:  
- **Structured data:** User profiles, roles, permissions.  
- **Unstructured data:** Lab reports, medical images, audio notes.  
- **AI-generated summaries:** Textual outputs from processed data.  

This DMP establishes policies for:
1. Data structure and relationships  
2. Storage method (SQL + NoSQL hybrid)  
3. Security, privacy, and encryption  
4. Backup, recovery, and lifecycle management  
5. Mapping between stored data and functional requirements  

---

## **2. Data Categories**

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **User Data** | Information for authentication and profiles | Name, Email, Role, Credentials |
| **Patient Data** | Demographics and health-related records | DOB, Gender, History, Contact |
| **Medical Files** | Uploaded files in multiple formats | PDFs, DICOM images, audio |
| **AI Summaries** | Processed summaries from uploaded data | Text summaries, linked file references |
| **Anonymization Data** | Records of removed PHI | File status, removed fields, verification |
| **System Logs & Notifications** | Operational and event logs | Login, upload, access, alerts |

---

## **3. Data Model Summary**

## **4. ER Diagram (Conceptual Model)**

**High-Level Relationships:**
- A **User** can be either a **Doctor** or a **Patient**.  
- Each **Patient** can have multiple **Files** and **Summaries**.  
- Each **File** has an **Anonymization record** (1–1).  
- **Doctors** generate **Summaries** for **Patients** (1–M).  
- **Audit Logs** track every user’s activity.  
- **Chats** and **Notifications** connect users asynchronously.

*(You can add your diagram here once created in Draw.io or Lucidchart)*

## **5. Data Security Plan**

### **A. Access Control**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  - **Doctor:** Access assigned patients and summaries only.  
  - **Patient:** Access own records and anonymized data.  
  - **Admin:** Manage users and logs, no medical data access.
- All endpoints validated via backend middleware and JWT tokens.

### **B. Encryption**
- **In Transit:** HTTPS (TLS 1.3) for all API communications.  
- **At Rest:** AES-256 encryption for all stored files and database fields.  
- **Authentication:** Passwords stored using bcrypt hashing.

### **C. Anonymization**
- All PHI (names, IDs, addresses) automatically removed before file processing.  
- Anonymization status stored in the `anonymization` collection.  
- Verification logs recorded in audit trails.

### **D. Audit & Logging**
- Every file upload, access, or modification is logged in `audit_log`.  
- Logs include timestamps, user IDs, and actions.  
- Regular reviews by admin for suspicious activity.

### **Daily Log: October  17, 2025**

## **Objective**
To document the process and method used to **convert the existing MultiMed Fusion web application** into a **fully functional mobile application** for iOS and Android platforms.  
The mobile version aims to preserve all core features — AI summaries, file upload, anonymization, and dashboards — while optimizing the experience for smaller screens and offline access.

---

## **1. Background**
The MultiMed Fusion web app was originally developed using:
- **Frontend:** React (with TailwindCSS)
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL and MongoDB (hybrid)

To increase accessibility for doctors and patients, the decision was made to develop a **mobile version** using the existing backend APIs while redesigning the frontend for native mobile experiences.

---

## **2. Chosen Mobile Development Approach**

| **Option** | **Description** | **Decision** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Native (Swift & Kotlin)** | Separate codebases for iOS and Android | ❌ Too time-consuming |
| **Cross-Platform (React Native)** | Single codebase using React principles | ✅ Selected |
| **Hybrid WebView** | Embed existing web UI into a container app | ❌ Limited offline and hardware access |

**Decision:** Use **React Native with Expo** to maximize code reuse from the web React app, ensuring cross-platform deployment.

---

## **3. Setup & Configuration**
- Installed **React Native CLI** and **Expo** for fast prototyping.  
- Cloned the existing **frontend repo** and modularized components for reuse.  
- Connected the app to the existing **FastAPI backend** using Axios.  
- Configured **React Navigation** for screen transitions.  
- Set up development environments for both:
  - **iOS (Xcode Simulator)**
  - **Android (Android Studio Emulator)**

---

## **4. UI & UX Redesign**
- Reworked layouts for **mobile responsiveness** and touch-based navigation.  
- Simplified dashboard menus and grouped key actions (Upload, Summary, Settings).  
- Added **tab navigation** and **bottom navigation bar** for easier access.  
- Integrated **native modules** for:
  - Camera access (file upload)
  - Microphone access (audio notes)
  - Local notifications

**Major Screens Designed:**
1. **Login & Signup**
2. **Doctor Dashboard**
3. **Patient Dashboard**
4. **File Upload (Camera / File Picker)**
5. **AI Summary View**
6. **Anonymization Confirmation**
7. **Notifications**
8. **Settings**

---

## **5. API Integration**
- Reused backend **REST APIs** developed for the web app.  
- Integrated endpoints for:
  - Authentication (JWT-based)
  - File upload
  - Summary retrieval
  - Anonymization status check
  - Notifications  
- Added **interceptors** for secure token handling and automatic logout on token expiry.  

Example Code:
```javascript
axios.get(`${API_URL}/summary/${patientId}`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
})
.then(response => setSummary(response.data))
.catch(error => console.error(error)) ;
