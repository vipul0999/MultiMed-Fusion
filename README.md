# MultiMed-Fusion
A tool that collects medical files like lab reports, medical images, audio notes and then uses AI to create easy to read summaries for doctors.

## üìå Problem Statement

Doctors often have to review information scattered across lab reports, medical scans, and dictated notes before making decisions. Going through each file one by one takes a lot of time, and important details can be missed under the pressure of heavy workloads. At the same time, patients worry about how safely their personal health details are handled when this data is stored or shared.

Right now, there isn‚Äôt a simple way to bring all these different types of medical data together in one place, summarize them clearly, and still keep patient privacy protected. MultiMed Fusion ‚Äì Multi-Modal Medical Data & AI Summary is designed to close that gap. The tool gathers data from different sources, removes sensitive identifiers, and produces an AI-generated summary with links back to the original files. This helps doctors save time, reduces their workload, and gives patients confidence that their information is handled responsibly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technicalities and Softwares Used

The MultiMed Fusion project uses a **Python (Flask/FastAPI) backend** with AI models built on **PyTorch/TensorFlow and Hugging Face** to generate summaries from medical reports, images, and audio notes.  
A **Bootstrap-based dashboard** presents these summaries with links to original files, while **spaCy, regex, and pydicom** ensure anonymization of sensitive data.  
Results are stored in **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**, tested with **PyTest and Postman**, versioned in **GitHub**, and deployed on **Render or Dockerized cloud environments** for accessibility.
