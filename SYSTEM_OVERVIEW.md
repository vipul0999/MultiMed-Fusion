# 🧠 System Overview – MultiMed Fusion

This document explains how the MultiMed Fusion system works from end to end — covering file flow, AI summarization, and security handling.

## 🔁 1. Data Flow Overview

Below is the general flow of data within the system:

1. **Doctor Uploads Files**
   - Accepts multiple file types: PDFs, medical images (DICOM), and audio notes.
   - Uploaded via secure API endpoints (`/upload`).

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Files are validated and stored temporarily.
   - Each file is checked for size, type, and integrity.
   - Metadata (timestamp, uploader ID, file type) is added.

3. **Anonymization**
   - Personal identifiers (names, emails, phone numbers, IDs) are masked.
   - DICOM metadata is stripped to comply with HIPAA.
   - Anonymization logs are stored for traceability.

4. **Text Extraction and Transcription**
   - **PDF/Text** → OCR or direct text extraction.
   - **Audio** → Speech-to-text using transcription API.
   - All extracted text is cleaned and merged into a unified dataset.

5. **Embedding & Storage**
   - Text is converted into **vector embeddings** using AI models.
   - Embeddings and metadata are stored in a **vector database**.
   - Original files are stored securely in S3 or local storage.

6. **AI Summarization**
   - The backend uses Hugging Face transformer models to generate a summary.
   - Multi-modal data (text, image, audio) is fused for a comprehensive report.
   - Summaries highlight critical insights (e.g., abnormal lab values).

7. **Summary Dashboard**
   - The frontend displays summarized reports with links to original files.
   - Doctors can filter by patient, date, or file type.

8. **Search & Query**
   - Doctors can ask natural language questions (e.g., “What are the patient’s last lab results?”).
   - The query retrieves relevant context using vector similarity search.
   - The AI model generates an accurate answer with source references.

## 🔐 2. Security & Compliance

| Security Area | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Authentication** | JWT-based login for doctors and admins |
| **Data Encryption** | HTTPS/TLS for data in transit, AES for data at rest |
| **Access Control** | Role-based permissions |
| **Audit Logs** | Track uploads, anonymizations, and summary generations |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA and GDPR guidelines followed |

---

## ⚙️ 3. Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **File Manager** | Handles upload, validation, and metadata storage |
| **Anonymization Engine** | Redacts PII and DICOM metadata |
| **AI Pipeline** | Runs text extraction, embedding, and summarization |
| **Vector DB Manager** | Stores and retrieves document embeddings |
| **User Auth Service** | Manages registration and JWT authentication |
| **Notification System** | Sends email alerts when summaries are ready |

---

## 🧪 4. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Validate functions in anonymization, file upload, and summarization modules.  
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure modules interact correctly (e.g., upload → summarize → store).  
- **API Tests:** Run through Postman collections to verify endpoints.  
- **Performance Tests:** Check response time and concurrency handling.  

---

## 🧭 5. Future Architecture Enhancements

- Add **real-time summarization progress tracking**.  
- Use **Celery + Redis** for asynchronous background processing.  
- Expand **multi-language summarization** using translation APIs.  
- Integrate **confidence scoring** for AI-generated results.
